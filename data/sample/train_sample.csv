Inactive lifestyle leads to a variety of diseases, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular dysfunctions, and
mental illness, and the sedentary behavior caused by diseases exacerbates pathogenesis. Irisin was identified
as an exercise-induced hormone that benefits multiple tissues/organs. Elucidating the molecular basis of irisin-
mediated effects via its integrin receptor may reveal a novel mechanism of hormone-induced integrin signaling,
and therapeutically, it will assist drug and antibody development to treat sedentary individuals to prevent disease
progression.",NIDDK,10464471,PA-21-048,1F32DK132864-01,1,F32,DK,132864,1, ,12547591,"A, MU ",Not Applicable,Unavailable,76580745,DPMGH9MG1X67,1464901,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,Independent Hospitals,22155450,UNITED STATES,"Training, Individual",2022,67582, ,NIDDK,67582,0, ,67582

 Delayed identification of infant head malformation is causing unnecessary medical complications and societal
costs, partly because of the absence of tools available to pediatric offices. For this Fast-track SBIR proposal,
PediaMetrix Inc. has joined forces with clinical institutions to develop and evaluate a 3D mobile scanning tool
that provides cranial volume and malformation measurements. Our tool, called SoftSpotTM, will improve the early
detection and management of infant cranial malformations at the point-of-care and avoid delayed, costly and

The continued rise in overdose rates and sheer number of preventable overdose deaths suggest a need to
improve practices of widely-established overdose fatality review (OFR) teams by shifting OFRs away from case
review and toward using timely, population-level data to better inform their recommendations and actions. Thus,
we will provide OFRs with a real time overdose-related dashboard and data-driven decision making training.
We anticipate that our proposed intervention will lead to better quality, actionable OFR recommendations;
increased OFR actions to implement evidence-based overdose strategies based on dashboard data; and long
term reductions in both fatal and nonfatal overdoses.",NIDA,10590303,RFA-DA-22-051,1R61DA057660-01,1,R61,DA,57660,1, ,7006225,"AALSMA, MATTHEW ","RAY, BRADLEY ; REDA, KHAIRI ",PEDIATRICS,603007902,SHHBRBAPSM35,577806,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,INDIANAPOLIS,IN,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,462022915,UNITED STATES,Non-SBIR/STTR,2022,1571023, ,NIDA,1124298,446725, ,1571023

Orthopedic trauma is common and often associated with profound pain and psychological distress that can
persist for years following injury and relate to long-term disability. To promote adaptive recovery, there is an
urgent need to elucidate factors that relate to pain and distress following orthopedic trauma and to develop
targeted psychological interventions that address these potentially disabling symptoms. This project will take
initial steps towards addressing this gap and will lay the groundwork for an independent research program that
will harness pain pathophysiology and affective science to promote adaptive recovery following orthopedic

The proposed program is a collaborative partnership between the University of Nigeria (UNN) and University of
California San Diego (UCSD) to strengthen UNN research administration and management infrastructure to
manage HIV research funds. The program will build research capacity at UNN by: 1) understanding the needs
and gaps in research administration and management at UNN; 2) improving the grants management and
proposal development knowledge, skills, and proficiency of UNN research administrators and HIV
implementation researchers; and 3) strengthening the ability of UNN research administrators and HIV
implementation researchers to submit successful NIH, CDC, and other donor-funded HIV grant applications by
providing mentorship, ongoing coaching and online courses from UCSD program instructors. The proposal will
train and mentor 12 UNN trainees through hands-on workshops and mentorship programs, and teach dozens of

While normally growing fetuses with healthy placentas have enough placental reserve capacity that Braxton
Hicks contractions do not significantly affect necessary placental oxygen transport, in dysfunctional placentas
with poor reserve these events may lead to hypoxic stress. There is a lack of information regarding the effect of
Braxton Hicks contractions in human pregnancies and whether these findings may provide information that will
inform development of future tests to identify fetuses at risk for adverse outcomes during delivery mediated by
placental dysfunction. We propose to characterize Braxton Hicks contractions across gestation, to analyze
spatio-temporal changes in placental oxygenation during these contractions and to monitor the effect of
placental oxygenation changes on fetal movement and fetal organ oxygenation via MRI.",NICHD,10535116,PAR-18-885,1R21HD106553-01A1,1,R21,HD,106553,1,A,14574456,"ABACI TURK, ESRA ",Not Applicable,Unavailable,76593722,Z1L9F1MM1RY3,1504801,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,Independent Hospitals,21155724,UNITED STATES,Non-SBIR/STTR,2022,227581, ,NICHD,128577,99004, ,227581

According to the American Sleep Association, 50-70 million US adults have a sleep disorder,
insomnia being the most common specific sleep disorder with 30% of adults reporting short term
issues and 10% reporting chronic insomnia. Meanwhile, 37.9% US adults reported unintentionally
falling asleep during the day at least once in the preceding month, while 4.7% reported nodding
off or falling asleep while driving at least once in the preceding month. Given that drowsy
driving is responsible for 1,550 fatalities and 40,000 nonfatal injuries annually in the US, this
remains a serious public health crisis requiring serious attention. Meanwhile, neuropathic pain
estimated in the general population to range between 3% and 17%, lacks an effective treatment as
most of the available treatments have only moderate efficacy and present significant side effects

 A major concern for human health is the ability of emerging viruses, drug-resistant bacteria, and mutating
cancer cells to adapt to ever-shifting host environments. Predicting evolution in fluctuating environments is
therefore important, but experiments thus far have mostly focused on adaptation to static conditions, due to the
difficulty of tracking large numbers of evolutionary paths in multiple conditions at high temporal resolution. We
will investigate how environmental variability and fitness tradeoffs steer evolutionary dynamics of populations

The complex biology of aging, characterized by a progressive loss of cellular and physiological function, is
particularly evident in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) where aging results in a reduced capacity to self-renew
and differentiate into lymphoid lineages. We propose a two-pronged approach for reversing HSC aging via
cellular reprogramming, involving 1) profiling molecular signatures of aging in HSCs at single cell resolution to
both develop metrics for aging and nominate transcription factors (TFs) involved in aging and self-renewal and
2) screening of TFs nominated by single-cell RNA-sequencing for restoration of HSC quiescence, self-renewal,
lymphoid/myeloid balance, and systemic effects in an in vivo mouse aging model. Novel TFs will be characterized
for their mechanism in renewing HSCs and restoring other downstream lineages in the bone marrow, and the
framework presented will provide a generalizable approach for understanding stem cell aging and discovering
new therapeutic interventions.",NIA,10334958,PAR-21-038,1R01AG074932-01,1,R01,AG,74932,1, ,14310805,"ABUDAYYEH, OMAR O","GOOTENBERG, JONATHAN SAMUEL",MISCELLANEOUS,1425594,E2NYLCDML6V1,4911501,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,CAMBRIDGE,MA,ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS,21421029,UNITED STATES,Non-SBIR/STTR,2022,601926, ,NIA,409446,192480, ,601926

Vagal tone, which naturally decreases with advancing age, allows the brain to control systemic inflammation,
via the brain-heart-immune axis. Even though excessive postoperative inflammation is hypothesized the cause

role of the brain-heart-immune axis in postoperative delirium remains unexplored. This study aims to establish
the role of the vagus nerve-mediated brain-heart-immune axis in postoperative delirium pathogenesis and,
thus, to facilitate the development of interventions to enhance preoperative vagal tone, to improve cognitive
outcomes after surgery, and to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias in the nearly 20

This proposed study addresses NINR’s Notice of Special Interest in the priority areas of social determinants of
health, health disparities, and health equity because of the disparate impact of incarceration on Black men and
the negative health outcomes associated with incarceration history, including increased mental health
symptom severity and diminished health-related quality of life. Little is known about how formerly incarcerated
Black men recognize and address their health concerns through health-seeking behaviors and engagement in
mental health care. With an enhanced understanding of how incarceration influences mental health symptom
severity, health-related quality of life, health-seeking behaviors, and engagement in mental health care, we will
be better positioned to develop targeted interventions to promote health-seeking behaviors, minimize barriers
to care, and improve health outcomes.",NINR,10465586,PA-21-052,1F31NR020434-01,1,F31,NR,20434,1, ,16620790,"ADDISON, HELENA ",Not Applicable,OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONS,42250712,GM1XX56LEP58,6463801,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,SCHOOLS OF NURSING,191046205,UNITED STATES,"Training, Individual",2022,46752, ,NINR,46752,0, ,46752

Using azide-containing hypervalent iodine reagents, we have developed a novel chemoproteomic
platform termed Protein Surface Azidation Mass Spectrometry (ProSurA-MS) that detects
conformational changes on protein surface with unbiased chemoselectivity. Combined with
bioorthogonal chemistry, ProSurA-MS effectively mapped dynamics of purified proteins upon
denaturation, protein-small molecule interaction, and protein-protein interaction, conformational
changes of a zinc-binding protein in whole cell lysate upon zinc depletion, and measured
proteome-wide azidation in live cells, thus potentiating the characterization of protein dynamics in
complex biological environments. The herein proposed studies will enable characterization of
dynamic changes in protein conformation induced by post-translational modifications and metal
binding, basic understanding of the chemical mechanism behind the ProSurA reaction and
development of second generation reagents with greater azidation yield and surface coverage,

A dramatic long-term effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is the expanded role of telemedicine integrated into
primary care, which is particularly significant for the more than 5 million people with dementia (PWD) and their
caregivers given the multi-faceted dimensions of clinical, social, and behavioral assessment and care for
dementia in the primary care setting. Drawing on data from two diverse health systems, UCSF Health and Kaiser
Permanente Northern CA, this project will study the implications of the COVID-induced expansion of
telemedicine across varied dimensions for PWD including equity of use, timeliness of care, and subsequent
near-term utilization. These findings, alongside insights from the broader literature, will be used to identify
strategies to tailor telemedicine use in primary care to better meet the needs of PWD.",NIA,10447947,PAR-19-070,1RF1AG077623-01,1,RF1,AG,77623,1, ,11405394,"ADLER-MILSTEIN, JULIA ROSE",Not Applicable,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,94878337,KMH5K9V7S518,577508,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,941432510,UNITED STATES,Non-SBIR/STTR,2022,2340878, ,NIA,1807666,533212, ,2340878

Epilepsy affects up to 1% of the population, causing disruptions in quality of life and even mortality due to
sudden death. In pediatric epilepsy especially, changes in a single gene of an ion channel are recognized as a
major contributor to infantile-onset seizures that can be very difficult to control with medications. This proposal

Epilepsy surgery can result in seizure freedom or a marked reduction in seizures in approximately two-thirds of
children with intractable seizures who have been carefully selected, with minimal adverse functional loss.
Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is an important non-invasive tool that allows the
neurosurgeon to precisely map regions of the brain supporting critical functions that should be preserved;
however, excessive head motion can lead to mis-identification of these regions, with direct implications for
treatment. The proposed project, “Motion and distortion robust diffusion weighted imaging sequences for
pediatric patients” promises to deliver a highly innovative imaging method capable of producing high-quality
connectivity maps in the presence of uncontrolled head motion by tracking the position of the head and
updating the acquisition in real-time.",NINDS,10366575,PA-20-185,1R01NS121657-01A1,1,R01,NS,121657,1,A,10519444,"AFACAN, ONUR ",Not Applicable,Unavailable,76593722,Z1L9F1MM1RY3,1504801,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,Independent Hospitals,21155724,UNITED STATES,Non-SBIR/STTR,2022,442500, ,NINDS,250000,192500, ,442500

Although metabolic demand from neuronal function has been shown to regulate vascular development in the
retina, a detailed mechanistic understanding of how neuronal activity influences angiogenesis and blood-retinal
barrier maturation remains unknown. This project will explore how cholinergic and glutamatergic neuronal
activities (separately or in combination) regulate retinal angiogenesis and blood-retinal barrier maturation using
genetic, molecular and imaging approaches. The knowledge gathered from this project may be of critical
importance to understand the pathophysiology of retinal diseases associated with neurodegeneration and

Childhood infections with Streptococcus pyogenes are associated with basal ganglia encephalitis (BGE), a
syndrome producing both movement and psychiatric sequelae; yet only a subset of infected children develop
BGE and the mechanisms underlying the human disease remain unclear. This proposal will examine the function
of one candidate genetic risk factor for post-infectious BGE (RXRA), identified through whole-exome sequencing
of pediatric patients and controls, using functional studies with human iPSC-derived microglia carrying mutation
identified in patients and loss-of-function studies in our animal model for post-infectious BGE. The study
represents a proof-of-concept to develop a translational platform for understanding how genetic factors in
combination with infectious agents (i.e. gene x environment interactions) cause an aberrant immune response
that targets the brain in post-infectious BGE.",NINDS,10574727,PA-21-219,1R21NS130265-01,1,R21,NS,130265,1, ,11090706,"AGALLIU, DRITAN ",Not Applicable,NEUROLOGY,621889815,QHF5ZZ114M72,1833205,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,100323725,UNITED STATES,Non-SBIR/STTR,2022,441853, ,NINDS,275000,166853, ,441853

investigate a localized and comprehensive approach of replicating retroviral delivery of RLI, an IL-15 fusion
protein, and other immunomodulatory genes as a therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma. Direct stimulation of an
anti-tumor T-cell mediated immune response through retroviral delivery of these genes will reverse the T-cell

Project Narrative: Smartphone-based wound infection risk screener and care recommender
by combining thermal images and photographs using deep learning methods.
There is currently no method to diagnose infections in undebrided wounds at the Point of Care (POC) (e.g., in
patients’ homes by visiting nurses), resulting in unnecessary referrals to wound clinics and increasing the time
to treatment of infections and the likelihood of eventual amputation. To facilitate early and accurate detection of
infected wounds at the POC, we propose a smartphone-based screener that jointly analyzes a combination of
photographs and a thermal image of a wound using deep learning methods. Our proposed system will detect
infections in both debrided and undebrided wounds and recommend evidence-based best care and when to
refer infected wounds to experts, standardizing the quality of care provided by non-expert wound caregivers.

Migraine headache is frequently accompanied by debilitating changes in sensitivity to
touch (allodynia) and light (photophobia). In this project we will measure the blink reflex
in people with and without migraine, and test if this response differs between the groups,
and if concurrent light stimulation alters sensitivity. A positive result would support the
hypothesis that a common change in the trigeminal system of the brainstem is at work in
sensory alteration in migraine.",NINDS,10578898,PA-21-219,1R21NS130565-01,1,R21,NS,130565,1, ,1869099,"AGUIRRE, GEOFFREY KARL",Not Applicable,NEUROLOGY,42250712,GM1XX56LEP58,6463801,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,191046205,UNITED STATES,Non-SBIR/STTR,2022,446875, ,NINDS,275000,171875, ,446875

The proposed preclinical research investigating the early stages of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in the novel
rice rat model is relevant to public health because establishing the timing and type/s of cell death affecting
osteocytes and its temporal relationship with radiographic, cellular, and molecular findings should improve the
capability to recognize the disease in the early stages and intervene to stop its progression. The project is also
significant because demonstrating that necroptosis plays a critical role in ONJ pathophysiology and that it can
be prevented using specific pharmacologic inhibitors will improve disease outcomes and reduce illness and
disability. Hence, the proposed research is relevant to the parts of NIH’s mission that foster: 1) fundamental
creative and innovative research strategies, as a basis to advance the nation’s capacity to protect and improve
health; and 2) pursuit of fundamental knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and

A major challenge in neuroscience is to uncover how defined neural circuits in the brain encode, store, modify,

modulate neural activity, and while a great deal of scientific and technical progress has been made, there is
still much to learn concerning complex neural function, especially within the context of natural behavior. Here,
we will fill this gap by developing open-source, head-mounted miniature microscopes with closed-loop

important questions about the role of Medicaid policy in access to treatment for criminal justice involved
individuals. Using a quasi-experimental approach and data from the Treatment Episode Datasets from 2000-

Damage to a brain region called the retrosplenial cortex leads to pronounced spatial disorientation as
well as severe memory deficits, but the retrosplenial cells, circuits, and computations supporting
healthy orientation and memory processing remain poorly understood. We have identified a unique,
small, excitable neuronal subtype within the retrosplenial cortex that is ideally positioned to support its
spatial orientation and memory functions. Here, we create novel electrodes and build comprehensive
transcriptomic maps to enable the future cell-type-specific dissection of orientation and memory
circuits within the retrosplenial cortex.",NINDS,10446099,RFA-NS-21-014,1R34NS127101-01,1,R34,NS,127101,1, ,8840205,"AHMED, OMAR JAMIL",Not Applicable,PSYCHOLOGY,73133571,GNJ7BBP73WE9,1506502,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,481091276,UNITED STATES,Non-SBIR/STTR,2022,678662, ,NINDS,447750,230912, ,678662

An eradicative cure requires elimination of virus reservoirs from all tissues, including lymph nodes, the gut and the central nervous system; therefore, a thorough understanding of HIV reservoirs that harbor intact and/or replication competent virus and give rise or support rebound viremia upon treatment interruption is paramount. Our novel approach using state-of-art technologies and models will define the role of microglia as a source for interferon-resistant rebound viruses in the correct cellular context and address a critical gap in our knowledge that is needed to eliminate HIV reservoir in the central nervous system.",NIMH,10548292,PA-21-235,1R21MH129193-01A1,1,R21,MH,129193,1,A,9626707,"AKAY ESPINOZA, CAGLA ",Not Applicable,PHARMACOLOGY,42250712,GM1XX56LEP58,6463801,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,191046205,UNITED STATES,Non-SBIR/STTR,2022,228125, ,OD,150000,78125, ,228125

Migraine is highly prevalent and debilitating, considered a major public health concern, and its underlying
pathobiology is not well understood. We propose to dissect a novel underlying mechanism, involving the
production of reactive nitroxidative species, and their downstream alterations to glutamatergic signaling and
neuroinflammatory mechanisms, which mediate nociceptive migraine-like responses. We will validate A3AR
agonists as a solution for the treatment of migraine, by modulating these underlying molecular mechanisms,
